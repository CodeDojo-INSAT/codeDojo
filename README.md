## Getting Started

Welcome to the CodeDojo.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `WEB-INF/classes` folder by default.
